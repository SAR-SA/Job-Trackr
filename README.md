## Project Description
Remote jobs are becoming more possible and desirable for both employers and employees. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that many companies can function just as well if not better while allowing their employees to work from home. However, the search for remote jobs can still be very tedious and demoralizing because it still often takes months of consistently applying before receiving any job offers.

As recent coding bootcamp graduates, we understand this dilemma all too well and have designed this app with our own demographic as the target audience. Our application allows users to create an account, search and apply for remote jobs, and track the applications every step of the way. It also has benchmark goals to keep the user motivated and on pace with their job search.
